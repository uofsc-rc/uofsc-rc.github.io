        <p>1. If you are off-campus ensure you are connected to UofSCâ€™s VPN see <a href="https://uofsc-rc.github.io/sys-tutorial/getting-started">connecting to an HPC</a></p>
        <p>2. Navigate to <a href="https://login002.rc.sc.edu">login002.rc.sc.edu</a></p>
        <p>3. Login with your Hyperion credentials and do the DUO multifactor authlontication check.</p>

        <p>5. In the form enter the parition as "OOD_test", the number of hours you need(up to 24 hours), and number of nodes you need (for this tutorial I'll be using 1), leave the account field blank. See my sample below.</p>
        <p><img class="demo" src="https://uofsc-rc.github.io/images/jupyter-2.png" alt="account: blank, parition:OOD_test, hours: 1, nodes:1"></p>
        <p>6. If you were able to get a node, you will see screen below. Click the "Connect to Jupyter" button.</p>

        <p>7. You can then use the file nagivation system to either find the file you wish to open or you can create a new file by click new.</p>
        <p><img class="demo" src="https://uofsc-rc.github.io/images/jupyter-4.png" alt="new file button location"></p>
        <p>8. You can now access Juptyer notebook! Check out this <a href="https://github.com/uofsc-rc/uofsc-rc.github.io/tree/main/jobs/Jupyter/example-jupyter.ipynb">example notebook code for inspiration.</a></p>
